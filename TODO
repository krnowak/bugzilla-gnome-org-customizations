- Port extension - Splinter
- Port extension - Traceparser (https://launchpad.net/+branch/bugzilla-traceparser)
- Describe User:
  Instead of listing all possible attachment statuses, just get all of
  them and remove 'committed' from the list.
- Template Overrides:
  Maybe move digests hash into separate perl module, so we have
  prominent place for them instead of somewhere in the middle of
  Util.pm.
