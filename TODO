- Port extension - Splinter
- Describe User:
  Instead of listing all possible attachment statuses, just get all of
  them and remove 'committed' from the list.
- TraceParser:
  Check if GNOME Bugzilla uses mediumint for comment_id column in
  trace table. If so, add a code porting it to use integer.
- StockAnswers:
  Put stock responses in database. Maybe add an editor for stock
  responses. Validate stock responses whether they change the bug
  status (or it is resolution?) according to bug status workflow. Make
  it possible to specify for which products the stock answer is
  available.
