- Describe User:

  Instead of listing all possible attachment statuses, just get all of
  them and remove 'committed' from the list.


- GNOME:

  Add GNOME specific bug statues and resolutions and setup
  transitions. StockAnswers could then have a dep on GNOME.

  Is there a way to bump comment length limit? Not sure if we can
  override it in extension since it is defined in
  Bugzilla::Constants. Making the limit larger than 65535 could be
  useful for large stacktraces. In old bugzilla it is bumped to
  131072.


- PatchReport:

  The GNOME specific bug open statuses probably should be in GNOME
  extension.


- Splinter:

  Figure out the email format for Ops::add_review_links_to_email,
  because I am not really sure if it is correct, especially the one
  with "Created attachment..."


- StockAnswers:

  Put stock responses in database. Maybe add an editor for stock
  responses. Validate stock responses whether they change the bug
  status (or it is resolution?) according to bug status workflow. Make
  it possible to specify for which products the stock answer is
  available.


- TraceParser:

  Check if GNOME Bugzilla uses mediumint for comment_id column in
  trace table. If so, add a code porting it to use integer.


- WeeklyBugSummary:

  Some products have way too many bugs. Break it down via component.

  Use percentages for the diff figures.

  Do we really want to exclude enhancement bugs from top N products?
  If so, maybe we should be consistent in excluding it from the rest
  of reports in this extension. Check it.
