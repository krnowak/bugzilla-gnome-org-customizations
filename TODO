- Port extension - Splinter
- Port extension - Traceparser (https://launchpad.net/+branch/bugzilla-traceparser)
- Port extension - Weekly status page (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=weekly-bug-summary.html)
- Describe User:
  Instead of listing all possible attachment statuses, just get all of
  them and remove 'committed' from the list.
- Template Overrides:
  Maybe move digests hash into separate perl module, so we have
  prominent place for them instead of somewhere in the middle of
  Util.pm.
- New extension - CfGnomeFields
  This one would probably create cf_gnome_target field if it does not
  exist and remove cf_gnome_version if it exists. Browse extension
  would depend on it.
