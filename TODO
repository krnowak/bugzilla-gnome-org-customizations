Hooking to user won't work - currently the hook requires comment, bug
and a mode to be defined.  The user templated is cached and then the
cached version is used in the comments.  Unfortunately, the caching
for the first time happens in table with attachments.  Here, comment
and mode are not defined.

Simplest solution would be modifying the template before closing span
with "bz_comment_user" class by adding the contents of Developer's
hook.

More sophisticated solution would involve another cache.
