- Splinter
- Traceparser (https://launchpad.net/+branch/bugzilla-traceparser)
- Weekly status page (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=weekly-bug-summary.html)
- Browse page (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/browse.cgi?product=Evolution)
- Describe user page (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=describeuser.html)
- New extension - ExtensionDeps
Create a new extension that will keep the data about dependencies
between extensions. For example PatchStatus depends on
GnomeAttachmentStatus. In future Browse would depend on DescribeUser
and DescribeUser would depend on Browse, Splinter would depend on
GnomeAttachmentStatus, WeeklyStatusPage would depend on Browse and
DescribeUser and so on.

The aim is to have a single place where dependencies are actually
checked during checksetup.
