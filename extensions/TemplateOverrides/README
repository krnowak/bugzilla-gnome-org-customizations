ABOUT
=====

This extension is a central place to store template overrides. It also
tracks if overridden templates haven't changed. If they did, then
checksetup will fail.

TERMS
=====

Template override - it is our version of a template.
Overridden template - it is an original version of a template we are
overriding.

ADDING NEW TEMPLATE OVERRIDE
============================

Let's assume we have a bugzilla-gnome-org-upstream repo in <BGOU>
directory and a bugzilla-gnome-org-customizations repo in <BGOC>
directory. Also let's assume that we want to override a
bug/edit.html.tmpl file.

Follow these steps to add a new template override:

1. Locate the bug/edit.html.tmpl file in <BGOU>. It is in
   <BGOU>/templates/en/default/bug/edit.html.tmpl.

2. Compute its sha256 (with i.e. sha256sum).

3. Open <BGOC>/extensions/TemplateOverrides/lib/Digests.pm and add an
   entry to digests hash (just follow already existing entries). It
   would look like this:

   'bug/edit.html.tmpl' => '<SHA256SUM>',

   Please ensure that the new entry is put in an alphabetic order.

4. Copy the file <BGOU>/templates/en/default/bug/edit.html.tmpl to
   <BGOC>/extensions/TemplateOverrides/templates/en/default/bug/edit.html.tmpl.

5. Add the new file and changes in Digests.pm to git, commit.

6. Make changes in the template override, add changes to git, commit.

I separated steps 5. and 6., so we can clearly see our changes in the
template override with git log -p.

Also, I recommend keeping changes in overrides as minimal as
possible. It would be best if the changes were limited to just adding
a hook. That could be even upstreamed at some point so we would be
able to remove an override.

TRACKING CHANGES
================

Tracking changes is implemented by basically comparing sha256
checksums during checksetup. Checksetup looks for overridden template
files, computes their sha256 checksums and compares them with relevant
entries stored in Digests.pm. If the checksums are different then it
means that (barring any mistakes) the overridden template has changed
since we added an override and this fact has to be acknowledged.
Checksetup fails at this point.

ACKNOWLEDGING THE CHANGES IN OVERRIDDEN TEMPLATES
=================================================

It is usually done in two steps:

1. Backport the changes in the overridden template to template
override.

2. Compute the sha256 sum of the overridden template and update the
relevant entry in Digests.pm.
